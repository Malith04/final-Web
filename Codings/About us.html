            Welcome to Max Burn Gym, An innovative fitness management solution
            developed by Group 5 of NIBM. It is a system that is aimed at
            showering the members of the gym with the best experience and at the
            same time giving many administrative possibilities to the
            administrators. Thus, it makes the whole gym management process much
            smoother and carries out various tasks such as the class scheduling,
            member's registration, and others. Digital transformation and the
            use of advanced technology are what put aside Max Burn System from
            the rest of the athletic and fitness spots. Allow technology to
